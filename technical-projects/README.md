# Inventory App Project - mySQL, Node.JS/Express, React

This is the starter code for a basic, front-to-back inventory application, used an alternative to the week 9 inventory application project of the SWE 2.0 curriculum.

The project is expecting to use React on the frontend, with create-react-app already set up in /frontend. It uses mySQL as its query language, uses XAMPP to run the database itself, and uses phpmyadmin to give a GUI to help manage your database.

# loginproject and Deployment using Docker project 

Login project was a project that I worked on during my apprenticeship uses Springboot, Java, Mongo DB. 
This project allows a user to be created, encypted, and stored in a Mongo DB. 
Then user is able to login with the valid user credentials. Credentials are sent to the Mongo database and the credentials are 
authenticated and authorized to allow a successful login for the user. 


        - JF 2.5: Can implement a responsive User interface
        - JF 3.3: Can link code to data sets 
        - JF 3.4: Can create a logical and maintainable codebase 
        - JF 3.8: Can encrypt sensitive date via hashtag
        - JF 4.1: Organizational policies and procedures relating to the tasks being undertaken, and when to follow them. For example, the storage and treatment of GDPR sensitive data
      

Imbedded in this repository is also the project I worked on for our Deployment Module. The goal of this project was to deploy an application
using Docker containers (I decided to use my previous login project application) and implement a CI/CD pipline that includes automated testing. 


        - JF 4.3: Is able to build, manage, and deploy code into the relevant environment

This project was worked on with 3 other people and we all had our own assigned function for this React app. My assigned portion of the project was to create the Navbar that contained links that routed the user to the corresponding page they wanted to be sent to in this TicketMaster clone project.

This project contains Job Functions - 1.4, 2.3, 2.4, 6.3, and 6.7)
