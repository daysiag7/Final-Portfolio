# Final Portfolio

This repository is a collection of the work and key learnings during my 2022-2023 apprenticeship at American Express.

## Overview

During my time at Multiverse and American Express, I had the oppurtunity to start my journey as a Software Engineer via Multiverse, and I was also fortunate enough to see a different world related to Software Engineering, this being Site Reliability Engineering. My team is a SRE/Application Support team where we work in a Production Environment mainly, but also support Development and Testing Environments for our applications. 

## Technical Projects 

In this section, there are a few of the projects I have worked on individually, collaboratively throughout the modules during my apprenticeship. Also in this section is a timeline of my learnings as being apart of an SRE organization. 

## Durable Skills 

This sections contains a README file that outlines some of the important skills that I have learned on the job at American Express and Multiverse.

## Acknowledgements

I'd also like to thank American Express for providing this oppurtunity, for employing me, and giving me an enviroment to hone my skills. I am truly grateful for this wonderful oppurtunity.
